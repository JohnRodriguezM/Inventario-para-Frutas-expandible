Deploy üì¶

In this project, I used JSON-server to generate a fake rest API, so if you need to turn on the server to see the app follow the next steps:

first one: use any IDE to open this project
second one: open the terminal
third one: write this command
JSON-server -w -p 8000 db.json

That's all, at the port 8000 will be the API in JSON format

and lastly use the link to open the page

Built with üõ†Ô∏è:

- HTML
- CSS
- JS
- JSON-server
